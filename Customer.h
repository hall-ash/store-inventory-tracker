/*
 file name: Customer.h
 author: Hall, Ashley
 The Customer class holds each customerâ€™s 3 digit ID, their name, and their
 transaction history. Customer objects are sorted alphabetically by name.
 The transaction history is represented by a vector of pointers to Transaction
 structs which hold Collectible pointers and action chars.
 The Customer class will assume ownership for the memory of pointed-to
 Transaction structs in the transactions vector and the Collectible pointers
 they contain.
